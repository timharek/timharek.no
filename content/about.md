Hi, I'm Tim Hårek Andreassen, a technologist from the west-coast of Norway. I
like to write about [programming](/tags/programming), [logging](/logs),
[note-taking](/tags/note-taking), what I've learned, and more. I care about
making things that respect people, in terms of their privacy, security, user
experience, and time.

Beside my personal website I work as a software engineer at Value Technology in
Bergen, Norway. I dabble with full-stack development, software architecture,
maintainability, automation, customer relations, and sysadmin stuff.

During my spare time I learn about new technologies, write the occasional
blogpost, automate my everyday, 3D-print something I (definitely) need, and
hangout with family (SO, daughter, cat, and dog)!

Check out my [now](/now)-page for what I'm up to now, or my [more](/more)-page
to checkout more stuff on my website.
