This month felt like two months, I don't know why.

## 🍀 Life

`age++` this month, I have less than a year left in my twenties, not that I
worry about that. But friends and family always like to point that out when
one's age is closing in on a round number.

Besides turning 29, we managed to buy a fucking house, a full standalone house
with a double garage, and carport. We're going to have a lawn, huge driveway,
more responsibility, and a huge mortgage! And we managed to sell our current
house in a housing cooperative. We were worried a minute about not being able to
sell our current place before we take over the new house, but we did it!

And after telling everyone last month that we were having another kid, we found
out this month that we're having another daughter! Next year looks amazing!

## 💪 Health

Started off strong this month with regular running, but then I suddenly started
getting massive headaches after my runs and after sleeping. I've been going to a
physiotherapist the last month to figure out what's giving me the headaches, and
it seems like we connected it to me being "stiff" in the neck and not breathing
correctly because of my posture. Which also affected my sleeping position. I've
had the headaches on-and-off for the last five years, but they have never been
as severe as they've been now. And after figuring this out the headaches have
been absent! Hopefully knowing what seems to be the cause will limit how often
it affects me.

Besides headaches, I also managed to get pretty sick in the end of the month.
Winter is coming.

## 🧑‍💻 Development

No development this month. Been busy with work, buying, and selling houses,
family-life, and a bit of gaming.

## 🎬 Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

### Movies

- **His Mother's House (1974)** – WTF.
- **Predator: Badlands (2025)** – Awesome movie! I never thought I would root
  for a Yautja, and a synth!
- **Predator (1987)** – Couldn't remember having watched this. I'm impressed
  that this movie was the "origin" of the Predator-franchise. Today it's a bit
  more silly than serious. The music/score element to this movie is so weird
  compared to today's movies. Well, at least I got "Get to da choppa!" quote and
  another meme-scene.
- **Roofman (2025)** – Awesome story. The US is weird, but its weirdness makes
  for a lot of great stories to be told, and made in to entertainment for the
  rest of us.
- **Bugonia (2025)** – WTF. How the turn-tables. I initially thought that this
  was a regular thriller, but when I started the movie I saw that it was a
  comedy. This movie had us second-guessing what was going to happen more than
  once. Cool movie. Conspiracy dudes are weird dudes.

### TV

Started watching Pluribus. Not sure if we even like it, but the premise is good.

### Games

**ARC Raiders** came out, and I have been having a fucking blast. The game is
super fun with friends, duos, and trios, but it's also fun solo. The last time I
have had so much fun with an online-only game must've been in junior high-school
when I discovered Counter-Strike.

I finished **Dispatch**: I love the superhero genre, especially when they try to
do something different. In this game it worked really well. I played the game
with QTE disabled, because I wanted a TV show experience with my own decisions,
and the game fully delivered on that. The characters are top-notch, and now they
need to create comic-books about this universe, because I need more! And the
game played excellent on Linux.
