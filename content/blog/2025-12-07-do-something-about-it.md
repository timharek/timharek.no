We have all seen it, read it, experienced it. Lately on the interwebs, people
have been complaining a lot about how things was better before, and how
everything is turning to shit now. I even made a draft-post myself in October
where I also wanted to complain about how everything has gotten so fucking
complicated and complex. I stopped writing that draft because I realized I was
doing exactly what I'm about to criticize... just adding to the noise instead of
offering something actionable. So here we are.

By reading the title of this post you may have guessed where I'm going.
Complaining, reminiscing about the past, thinking about simpler solutions,
ranting, venting, etc. It's all good, and it can be healthy, it's definitely
good to read and learn from other's experiences.

If something was better back in the day: can you switch back to it? Can you
complain to someone who can fix it? Can you live without it? Can you fix it? We
all love to complain, heck, I fucking love to complain, I do it so much that I
get tired of myself...

When I became more privacy-aware in 2018, I complained to everyone who was using
mainstream social media, lecturing them about everything. Most of them agreed
and acknowledged that they probably shouldn't use it, but because of the network
effect, everyone was already there. Three years later, in 2021, I took a leap in
my personal life and deleted every social media account, I did something about
it. I still have contact with friends and family, not to the same extent that I
used to before I deleted everything, but I'm certain I'm better off.

My goal with this post isn't to tell everyone to delete their social media, but
that this can be applied to other areas too! Maybe you are using Kubernetes at
work, and you know that Kubernetes is not needed for a simple marketing website.
Do something about it. Question it. Maybe you don't like that you write all your
code in JavaScript at work. Nothing happens by itself. You can do something
about it.

Heck, I've even been on the receiving end of my last example. A coworker asked
if we could try to use Go for an upcoming integration-project, at first I was
hesitant because all of integration-projects were written in TypeScript. But I
said we could try it and see if it was a good fit. And since then we have only
used Go for all our integration-projects.

And yes, I know, this doesn't count for everything, everyone, and everywhere.
But if you never try, you never know.

Sometimes it's faster to do something about it, instead of complaining or
waiting for someone else to fix it. The gap between complaining and doing
something is smaller than you think. And it's easier to not be an asshole about
it if you do something about it.
