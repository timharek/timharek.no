Once again, time moves fast, and here we are, with another monthly update.

From the blog since my last recently post:

- [Hima Devlog #1](/blog/2025-10-21-hima-devlog-1)

## üçÄ Life

To be honest it feels like a lot of stuff is happening at the moment. I thought
the rest of the year was going to be pretty chill, but we have made some last
minute changes to our foreseeable future. I know, it sounds mysterious, but in
reality it just means that we have just these last couple weeks started looking
for a new house. I have always wanted a real standalone house, not a duplex, or
a housing cooperative, an actual house, with a garage... or two! So we are on
the lookout for that at the moment, and that means we are also selling our
current place. Hopefully we get everything sorted within the first half of
November!

And another nice addition to the "last minute changes" for the year, well, not
this year, but next year, we're having another kid! Super stoked about that, and
having difficulties imagining what life will look like with not just one kid,
but two.

## üí™ Health

I've kept up with the running, mostly in the mornings before work. It's really
nice having already done a proper workout of 5 km before taking my daughter to
kindergarten and heading for work. I do have to wake up earlier, but the outcome
really makes it worth it.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

I have [worked a bit on Hima][hima-devlog1], and I'm writing the next devlog at
the same time I'm finishing up some stuff. I have started to use the latest
version of Hima in production for our stuff. It's really fun to see how much
faster and better the reimplementation is. I know it's not just because I
rewrote it in a "better" language, but because I now know more about the domain
and problem-space. And that I'm just a better developer now than I was when I
initially started working on it.

And somewhat related, when I decided to host the new version of Hima, I fired up
a new VPS on Hetzner. Where I also setup [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
that connects to Hetzner's
[Storage Box](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box/), which means I have
now replaced my need for Nextcloud. All my personal stuff is stored on my
computer, synced to my VPS and phone. This means that the receipts Hima sees on
the VPS, I also see on my local machine, making it super fast to push new
receipts. And of course other stuff. It's not super fast, both because I should
use Hetzner Volumes if I want proper storage attached, but their Storage Box
works fine mounted with `sshfs`. It's also fairly cheap. All this should be a
proper write-up in a [Kaizen]-post, because I changed more than replacing
Nextcloud with Syncthing.

## üé¨ Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

### Games

I haven't finished any games this month, but I picked up **The Drifter** on my
Steam Deck and I have enjoyed two-three hours of it so far. It's a really nice
point-and-click-adventure game with an amazing pixel-art style.

And besides **The Drifter**, I also played **ARC Raiders**' playtest a couple of
weeks back and I have been playing the full-game release for the last two
nights. It's really fun! I haven't really played any extraction-shooters before,
but this game doesn't feel like a chore, it's more quick-fun and a match can be
a lot of action, or it can be quick and chill.

### Movies

- **One Battle After Another (2025)** ‚Äì Excellent! I had a blast throughout this
  whole movie. The music was really cool and fit to every scene. The story of
  the revolutionists was really cool, and how they communicated together. I
  highly recommend!
- **Treasure Planet (2002)** ‚Äì I remember watching this movie as a kid, and that
  I loved it. I didn't remember any details, but after rewatching it, I still
  love it!

### TV

- **Peacemaker (2022)** ‚Äì I liked the retcon from season 1 from DCEU. It was fun
  seeing all the main characters playing alongside each other as friends
  throughout the whole season. And Vigilante, what a great character, the actor
  nails it. I want a spin-off show for just Vigilante with his vigilantism and
  interactions with his mom and day-to-day.
