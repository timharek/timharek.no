Yesterday I thought I should try to find a better alternative to Apple Mail on
macOS, because I've been missing good shortcuts (and vim ofc.) when I navigate
my mailboxes and compose new emails. So I remembered I discovered [`aerc`][aerc]
earlier this year, so I gave it another look.

For those who don't know, `aerc` is a terminal based email client that uses
vim-like bindings. It's very customizable and the configuration steps are easy
enough to understand. It supports plain-text and HTML-emails, but with HTML
emails it requires an extra line of configuration in `aerc.conf`. You can find
my configurations [here][aerc-conf].

I setup my `aerc` for my personal emails to begin with, if I find it's not
becoming an inconvenience after a few weeks of use I might try to add my work
email as well. But I guess I have to configure it some more if I'm going to use
it for work, as I've already deleted some old emails by accident ðŸ˜….

## UPDATE: 2022-01-09

I used `aerc` for a month or two and decided to switch back to Apple Mail. It's
missing some features that I rely on, like aliases. It also crashes when it has
been open for a certain amount of time. I might checkout `neomutt` in the
future.
