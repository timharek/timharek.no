The shortest month is at an end, so here we are!

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing

Hugo is giving me energy to write more. Here's what I wrote this month:

- [AI saved my computer from water damage](/blog/ai-saved-my-computer-from-water-damage)
- [I accidentally went static again](/blog/i-accidentally-went-static-again)
- [Trying out Zen Browser](/blog/trying-out-zen-browser)

## üçÄ Life

Although February is the shortest month, it sure feels like I managed to do a
lot this month. The sun rises earlier and goes down later, and I can really feel
an impact on my overall mood and energy level. And our daughter has started
speaking a lot more, combining words, saying sentences, and she's just so
joyful!

## üí™ Health

After my slacking of last month because of sickness, weather and other excuses I
came up with, I have managed to run 63 km this month. And to my surprise I even
managed to put in some longer runs after work. And my focus hasn't been to run
fast, rather to keep active and finish, and then be happy with that.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

I've done some minor maintenance on my website, tweaked my Hugo archetypes to
use my logs and bookmarks. It makes writing this post much more convenient
without having to open different stuff to copy/paste.

I scrapped my initial idea for my personal CLI-tool to use SQLite, even though I
had the initial implementation done. I decided against having to move around a
SQLite-file versus having logs files for the different stuff I track. Now it
crawls the current working directory to look for specific files based on what I
want to log. It works well with how I've set up my Hugo-site. I still have some
stuff to do, as always. I will write a post about the tool when it's done.
Hopefully in March.

My CLIs are now available via Homebrew. I thought was much more complicated to
set up my own Homebrew-tap, but it took me less than five minutes. You can see
my [GitHub-repo](https://github.com/timharek/homebrew-tap) for more details.
Only my tap is hosted on GitHub, the actual tools are hosted on my preferred
source-forge, SourceHut. Now you can run

```bash
brew tap timharek/tap
brew install yr
brew install migadu
```

Or for short:

```bash
brew install timharek/tap/yr
brew install timharek/tap/migadu
```

Now I'm more confident with publishing my tools for others to use.

And just an hour before writing this my [TRMNL] arrived at my door. Haven't
gotten to tinker with it any more than setting up an initial screen. I will
write a review of this thing, so far it's cool!

## üé¨ Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

### Movies

Not a lot of movie watching this month, I have however bought a bunch of movies
on Blu-ray this past month. Hopefully I will find some time for them soon!

- **The Substance (2024)** ‚Äì The concept was well executed up until the third
  act. Then everything became so ridiculous. It was good social commentary
  towards the absurd beauty standard people have to live up today, except the
  third act. I got the point long before that.

### TV

Still watching **Severance S2**, but also started watching **Reacher S3** and
**Invincible S3**. All these shows are excellent!

- **Sugar (2024)** ‚Äì Almost relaxing TV-show, the atmosphere was great and I
  like Colin's voiceover. The twist was very unexpected.

### Games

- **Kingdom Come: Deliverance II** ‚Äì Fantastic game! It kept me engaged for more
  than 50 hours on end. The story was grounded in a medieval-setting I can
  believe. The combat is fun and interesting, the characters and choices you get
  to make is really something. I haven't had an engaging experience like this
  since the first time I played Skyrim back in 2011.
