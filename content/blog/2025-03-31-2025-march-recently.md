First quarter of 2025 is over and here I am with another post about what I've
been up to since February!

From the blog this month:

## üçÄ Life

This past month our daughter has learned to say at least 100 words, she is
closing in on 200 words now, and she's not even two years old. We get surprised
every day whenever she says a new word, and she's putting them together to make
up short sentences. It's really something extraordinary.

And my SO got a new job, which is huge for us! It will make things easier for us
for sure and she also has a flexible workday, same as me, which we think will
highly benefit us.

## üí™ Health

On and off with a bit of sickness again. Haven't been running regularly, but I
have managed to sneak in some cycling and strength training. My goal for April
is to figure out a real routine.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

I've been making progress on my [Hima] rewrite in Go. I decided to switch out
[sqlc] with [Gorm], and it made things a lot smoother. I have switched around a
few parts of the original version of Hima and decided that receipts are what the
app should revolve around, primarily. Easter is coming up in April, I might be
able to work on it continuously, we'll see.

Other than that I really haven't done anything outside of work. And I'm still
really enjoying writing Go. I learn new stuff almost every day and I discover
new projects on the regular. I feel much less constrained when I write Go in
comparison to other languages I have used.

## üé¨ Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

I wasn't aware that I had seen so many things this month, not sure if I'm
impressed or disappointed by how I spend my time üòÖ

### Movies

- **Gladiator II (2024)** ‚Äì I had high expectations. The motivation for the
  protagonist makes sense, but in comparison to the previous movie, we never
  learned how the protagonist become such a skilled swordsman and a leader type.
  And the sea-battle in the Colosseum looks cool on paper, but in the movie it
  was the most boring part.
- **Whiplash (2014)** ‚Äì Rewatch. Fantastic! The whole premise of the movie
  reminds me of a song by NF called the The Search. "Just think about it for a
  second, if you look at your face. Every day when you get up and think you'll
  never be great You'll never be great, not because you're not, but the hate
  Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith."
- **The Big Lebowski (1998)** ‚Äì I thought it was a rewatch, but I didn't
  remember anything from this one. There were some hilarious scenes, but overall
  pretty meh, imo.
- **Captain America: Brave New World (2025)** ‚Äì The whole movie felt off. The
  pacing, acting, and the stakes. Some of the scenes felt like they were put
  together last minute and some of the CGI was awful, especially when Sam talks
  with Ross at the end of the last fight.
- **Mickey 17 (2025)** ‚Äì Awesome story! I liked the subtle and not-so subtle
  social commentary, and how the antagonist was a parody of multiple well know
  figures.
- **Speak No Evil (2024)** ‚Äì Fun to see two opposites from Halt and Catch Fire
  play a couple, and in a horror-setting! I enjoyed this movie. The setting hits
  close to home as my SO and I went to visit a friend couple I had met online
  five year prior while gaming. In our case I had known them for five years
  online, but for my SO, she had only spoken to them once before meeting them in
  person.
- **The Ugly Stepsister (2025)** ‚Äì What a movie. So weird and fucked up, but
  funny! They took a page or two out of the original story and just went
  bananas.
- **Click (2006)** ‚Äì Rewatch. Today this movies makes me think of AI, and how we
  should use it carefully and not overdo it.

### TV

- **The White Lotus (2021)** ‚Äì People have hyped this up too much. It was
  mediocre at best. The last two episodes was better than the others.
- **INVINCIBLE (2021)** ‚Äì It's the most intense entertainment I have ever seen.
  There's never a dull moment, and whenever I think a character is OK or when I
  start to care about someone... BAM! Something insane happens. I really liked
  the different storylines in this season in comparison to the other two
  seasons. Season 4 can't come soon enough!
- **Severance (2022)** ‚Äì Captivating from start to finish! After watching two
  seasons of this show I'm certain that I don't want to separate my work and
  personal life into two separate identities.
- **The Day of the Jackal (2024)** ‚Äì Excellent from start to finish! The story,
  characters, technology, and over all a really good show. All of the episodes
  lived up to the pilot/ep1.
- **Reacher (2022)** ‚Äì Started of great, became more generic towards the end,
  but overall great season!

## üåê Links

- [Garbage] ‚Äì I believe this is what we do in Norway, we put our trash in our
  pockets or backpacks and empty them whenever possible (or when we remember to
  do so). It's not uncommon for there to be no trashcans when hiking in the
  mountains or along the trails.
- [A Society That Lost Focus] ‚Äì It's been a while since I've nodded to so much
  in one post.
- [Git Koans] ‚Äì Master Git, I have become enlightened.
- [Can we communally deprecate git checkout?] ‚Äì I do agree, but I have been
  unable to teach myself switch. But maybe now is the time.
- [The Digital Packrat Manifesto] ‚Äì Recently I started buy physical media again,
  and it has resulted in me lending a blu-ray or two to friends and family. It
  feels more personal and intentional.
- [Make sure to clean your Go build cache] ‚Äì I had trouble with Gorm saying a
  migration was invalid, although the database was reset. This came in handy!
