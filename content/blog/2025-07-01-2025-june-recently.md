We're officially more than half-way through 2025! June has felt like the
shortest month so far.

## 🍀 Life

This month I've been to Berlin with my older brother and younger sister, as a
gift to our sister for her confirmation back in April. We went sightseeing, lots
of history and culture to uncover. We also went to two amateur standups, both
were excellent. It was an absolute blast!

I also went to my brother's bachelors-party in cabin for a weekend. It was lots
of fun, we did a lot of different activities 😅

Beside my adventures things have been settling more and more at home with my
SO's new job, and our daughter continuing to impress us every day.

We're taking time off from work in July, both because we need some "vacation",
but also because we're going to two weddings. Looking forward to those!

## 💪 Health

I contemplated not including health this month because I've been slacking with
everything. I only ran once a week in June, I did however go for more and longer
walks with the dog, but I haven't had the energy nor the time to go for runs. At
least that's my excuse.

## Development

In June I asked my boss if we could get Claude Pro subscriptions, and he said
yes, definitely! So this month I have used Claude Code a whole lot. I'm not
scared to be replaced as a software engineer, but I'm afraid we'll all become
"dumber" by using AI 😅 I'm very impressed by how Claude Code just (mostly)
works. I get an iffy feeling whenever I get it to write code for a larger
problem, it feels like cheating. I'm thinking about writing a whole blogpost
about my experience with Claude Code, and why I think it works so good.

Besides my AI ventures, I have worked a tiny bit on Hima:

- Added search, with filter queries
- Added login with passwords (I only store the hash), with optional magic-links
- Added user register-page
- Started using gorilla/schema for parsing forms and query params
- Added invite-logic for users to invite users to their instance via links

I also released v1.0.0 of [yr](https://sr.ht/~timharek/yr/)! It feels
"feature-complete", at least for now. It's a great tool that I use daily. It's
fast and reliable.

## 🎬 Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

### Movies

- **Predator: Killer of Killers (2025)** – Cool animated movie! I thought this
  was going to be TV show, and it seems like that was the original intention in
  terms of how the movie was structured. But it was good nonetheless!
- **Mountainhead (2025)** – WTF. How do they come up with this?
- **28 Days Later (2002)** – An alright movie. I'm trying to watch this and 28
  weeks later in preparation for 28 years later. I like the premise, rage
  infection.
- **28 Weeks Later (2007)** – Like the previous one, this one felt low budge,
  and the story wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I noticed that they reuse
  the music score all the time... and it wasn't great. Hopefully the new one is
  great!

### TV

- **MobLand (2025)** – An awesome crime, mafia, drama, etc. etc., fucking TV
  show! It was a blast beginning to end! I loved all the characters. The twists
  were great. Not a lot I actually saw coming. I recommend this show to everyone
  that likes the crime/mafia genre. My last 10 Sundays have been an absolute
  blast!
- **Clarkson's Farm (2021)** – It so much fun to watch these people run a farm
  😂
