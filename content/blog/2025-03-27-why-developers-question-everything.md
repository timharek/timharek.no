As a developer myself, I've noticed something about our profession that feels
controversial to admit: we question everything, sometimes to the point where we
might seem like we're being difficult. And I'm not here to tell you that this is
a problem, per se, it more like an observation.

## Bathroom renovation vs. a software integration

I believe developers have a unique approach compared to other professionals.
Let's consider this comparison:

### Bathroom renovation

Imagine you're renovating your bathroom. The process typically goes like this:

1. You request a quote, explaining what you want.
1. After some back and forth, you agree on a price.
1. Work begins and the contractor discovers unexpected issues (electrical
   issues, plumbing etc.).
1. They handle it, but inform you it will cost more.
1. You agree because you want the bathroom finished.
1. Work completes, perhaps with some delays and more price adjustments.

This example feels normal. We accept that physical work involved unforeseen
circumstances, and we generally trust the professionals to handle them.

### Software integration

Now, imagine you need to integrate two systems and sync data between them:

1. You ask a developer if it's possible.
1. They respond with "it depends" and list various factors.
1. You establish that yes, it's possible.
1. Then the developer asks: "What's the minimum you need for this to work?"
1. You explain that you want everything synced.
1. The developer asks: "Why?"
1. (joke) You get frustrated and renovate your bathroom instead.

The last question is where developers diverge from other professions. We want to
take all the precautions we can to avoid future problems, we don't just take
requirements at face value – we question them, sometimes to the frustration of
stakeholders.

## Why do we do this?

It's not uncommon to feel like you're being difficult or a "cry-baby" when
you're met with a frustrated client that "just" wants you to do what they ask
you. Software isn't the same as physical work. You don't need a lot of
experience to know that:

- The cost of change in software can be exponentially higher after the
  implementation.
- Unnecessary complexity is a nightmare to maintain and kills projects.
- Asking a lot of questions sometimes reveals simpler solutions.

It's our responsibility to ask questions. We're trying to save time, money, and
future headaches by challenging assumptions early.

The goal isn't to avoid work – it's to do the right work for the right reasons.
