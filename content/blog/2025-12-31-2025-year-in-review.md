This is my fourth [year in review](/tags/year-in-review/). Looking back at those
four years, a lot of things has happened. 2025 feels like a long, but good
mountain hike. My thighs are hurting, but view is so worth it!

## Looking back

### Yearly themes

2025's yearly theme was **Year of analog**, it involved the following:

- Read more physical books
- Download more long-form content onto my reMarkable
- Leave my phone behind
- Write blogposts in my notebook or on my reMarkable before publishing
- (maybe ditch my Apple Watch (again))

Spoiler alert: I basically did none of this. I read one physical book. I did not
use my reMarkable at all (I charged it three times, but to no avail). I did
however leave my phone behind a fair bit, but not to the degree I was thinking
about at the end of 2024. Thinking and sketching for the blog was primarily done
digitally with a couple of exceptions for when I came up with a blogpost. The
idea of ditching my Apple Watch was a common thought throughout the year, I have
decided that I will not buy another when the battery dies.

My secondary theme was **Year of finishing**. I did finish [yr] and release a
`v1`. [Hima] is still under semi-active development, and I have a few ambitious
blogposts collecting dust in my drafts.

Overall, this year's result is lacking, I'm not happy with the results. But it's
not the end of the world, and I think my themes were too ambitious, at least
that's how it seemed.

### Life

I have a two year old daughter! We can talk together, we can have a
conversation, she can let me know when she is sad, hungry, happy, or wants
another raisin. I'm impressed, and so proud!

At the beginning of 2025 I started a new role at Value Technology, as a Tech
Lead. Our daughter was starting to really love kindergarten. I started buying
Blu-rays to rip into my digital library. Furthermore, my SO got a new job and
started traveling offshore where I learned that I'm fully capable of being a
single dad (at least for a few weeks).

I learned that family cruise to Denmark with a 1,5 year old is not ideal.
Joining our housing cooperative board I learned that there's actually a lot of
work that goes into operating a housing cooperative.

Got to experience my sister's public speaking skills twice, talking in front of
hundreds of people, both at her own confirmation ceremony and at our brother's
wedding.

Finally got the experience the awesomeness of having a car that "just works" and
doesn't have a bunch of maintenance planned, by [buying a Volkswagen ID. Buzz].

And ending the year by buying a fricking house (with double garage, carport, a
lawn etc.) and selling our old place!

### Health

I held a steady incline in the beginning of the year, but it started declining
after the summer. I've been more sick than usual, and so is dad-life. I didn't
sign up for any runs this year (compared to last year's 5).

### Blogging

In 2025 I have written 26 posts, where 12 of them were my monthly posts about
what I've been up to, resulting in 14 regular posts. Not a clear theme this year
either, I keep writing about what interest me.

I wrote a review of [Kagi] which, like last year's reviews, resulted in a few
people reaching out and telling me they gave Kagi a chance and appreciated my
thoughts.

My highlights of the year is [Do something about it] and [Why developers
question everything]. The latter ended up on [Lobsters], and made it clear to me
that my analogy had some flaws.

### Programming and development

I'm still super into Go after picking it up last year. I have used it for every
new project (not that many) this year. We use it for everything at work as we
primarily focus on integrations.

#### Projects

Looking at my repositories, both online and locally I can't see any new
projects. Which is probably a sign of having less spare-time after work, and
that I'm making do with the projects I still maintain.

I still do some minor stuff with [yr] whenever I learn something new about Go at
work, or when I work on [Hima].

And when it comes to Hima, I started remaking it in Go this year. I have made a
bunch of different and new design decisions compared to the old Deno/TypeScript
implementation. I also started a [devlog] about my progress.

[devlog]: /tag/hima

#### Website

I almost forgot that I [remade the whole website] earlier this year with Hugo.
It's almost identical with the old one, except it's static and the stats page is
less fancy.

### Entertainment

#### Movies and TV shows

I have watched 53 movies and 30 seasons of TV shows, resulting in approximately
106 hours watching movies (2 hours per movie) and 180 hours watching TV (45
minute episodes with 8 episode seasons), resulting in 286 hours in total. That's
about 3.2 % of the total hours of 2025.

Unlike last year, when I didn't have any favorite movie, I managed to watch
multiple "5/5" movies in 2025 (not counting rewatchs):

- **Superman (2025)**
- **Weapons (2025)**
- **One Battle After Another (2025)**
- **Predator: Badlands (2025)**
- **Sick of Myself (2025)**
- **Marty Supreme (2025)**

The best movie-movie, was **Weapons**. It was so eerie, and I couldn't look
away, although I wanted to multiple times. But there was also two standout
movies that was so much fun to watch, and that was **Superman** and **Predator:
Badlands**. With both those movies I didn't want the stories to end, and I'm
ready for the continuation of their stories!

Looking back at my top-rated TV shows this year, I have the following:

- **Silo S2**
- **INVINCIBLE S3**
- **Severance S2**
- **The Day of the Jackal S1**
- **Adolescence S1**
- **MobLand S1**
- **The Wire S1**

I liked all of those, but if I could give a show "6/5", it would be **MobLand
S1**. The story, setting, characters, just everything was so good about this
show.

#### Games

I picked up three games and one playtest this year:

- **Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (2025)**
- **Dispatch (2025)**
- **ARC Raiders (2025)**
- **The Lift (playtest)**

**KCD2** was a really cool medieval singleplayer story game. I had an excellent
time with the game. The story was cool. **Dispatch** had another really cool
story, and an entirely different game. But the game that really stole my time
and attention this year, was **ARC Raiders**. I haven't played a game like this
since high school, and I keep thinking about the next raid. The whole game is an
experience. And for all of my games in 2025, everything has run superbly on my
Linux PC. I haven't tweaked a single thing.

#### Books

I finished 6 books this year, where only one book was fiction:

- **How the World Really Works, Vaclav Smil**
- **Homeland, Cory Doctorow**
- **The Body, Bill Bryson**
- **At Home, Bill Bryson**
- **Information Doesn't Want to Be Free, Cory Doctorow**
- **The Internet Con, Cory Doctorow**

## Looking ahead

### Knowns and unknowns

Like last year:

> In software development we often talk about unknown unknowns, and I think that
> fits perfectly with everyday as well. And when heading into 2026 I know that
> some stuff will happen and there plenty of stuff that I don't know that will
> happen.

Some of the stuff I know that will happen in 2026:

- I'm saying goodbye to my twenties
- My daughter is turning 3
- We're having another daughter
- Move into a new (huge) house
- A bunch of people I know are having kids

I'm probably forgetting some stuff, but I'm making this list to prepare myself.
It's not an itinerary.

### Yearly themes

After this year's unsuccessful attempt for a yearly theme, I will lighten my
expectations for next year's themes.

In 2026 my primary yearly theme will be: **Year of communication**:

- Reach out to friends and family more
- Reach out to bloggers and let them know that I appreciate their writing
- Continue to educate people on how clear and open communication can speed up
  and make things easier (both at work and at home)
- Communicate more boundaries

And my secondary theme will be: **Year of slow**. After reading this post,
[Maybe the Default Settings Are Too High], I want to slow down and really take
in what I consume and be more present.
