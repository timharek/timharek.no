The first browser I used, to my knowledge, was Firefox. Back in the early 2000s
when my brother and I bought our first computer together. He was the
computer-wizard and knew what was good.

Since then I daily driven many different browsers, but I ended up with Firefox
again ~10 years ago. However, I must admit that I have up until yesterday used
Chrome for my work-related stuff because work uses Google Workspace and I wanted
an easy way to differentiate work and personal stuff.

Yesterday I recalled an earlier episode of the
[Changelog-podcast](https://changelog.com/),
[Changelog & Friends #76](https://changelog.com/friends/76) where they mentioned
a minimal browser called [Min](https://minbrowser.org/). I went to check it out,
and saw that it "is written entirely with CSS and JavaScript using Electron...".
Well, I didn't want to try it now. Then I headed over to
[AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/software/min-browser/?license=opensource)
and found [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/) after scrolling past the
regulars.

Zen is made with the gecko-engine, same as Firefox, and supports all of
Firefox's features, and Zen has made some additions.

After I installed it, it reminded me of Arc in terms of the design, but it
didn't [require an account](/blog/arc-browser-account) (yey!). Its highlighted
features are:

- _Workspaces_, for keeping your tabs organized
- _Compact Mode_, focus without distractions
- _Zen Glance_, view links without actually opening them
- _Split Views_, multiple tabs open at once
- _Sidebar_, vertical tabs

The key features for me, is the sidebar and workspaces. I have wanted to try out
vertical tabs, but Arc requires an account (and
[is dead?](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24279020/browser-company-ai-browser-arc)).
And for workspaces, the killer feature here is that it works with Firefox's
[Multi-account containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).

Now I have two workspaces, one for personal stuff (default) and one for work. I
can default my work-workspace to use the "Work"-container so that my cookies,
logins etc. don't bleed over into my personal browsing. And the
workspace-switching works effortless!

And as I'm writing this I just discovered the Glance-feature, this is awesome!

Having used the browser for a few hours now, it feels a lot like Firefox, but
with additional built-in features. And all my browser extensions works just like
before. I haven't encountered any bugs. It will probably take a while before I'm
fully used to vertical tabs, but so far so good!

There is one thing to take into consideration with Zen before commiting, and
it's that it doesn't support
[DRM-protected content](https://docs.zen-browser.app/faq#why-cant-zen-browser-play-drm-protected-content),
yet. If I need to watch something with DRM, I will fire up Firefox again.

Hopefully I can stop using Chrome for work now, and fully commit to using Zen. I
have changed my default browser to Zen for now, and hopefully I'm not
encountering any issues that requires me to switch back.
