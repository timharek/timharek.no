December is the slowest, fastest, and shortest month of the year. Everything has
to happen this month. But I survived!

From the blog since my last recently post:

- [Do something about it](/blog/2025-12-07-do-something-about-it)
- [2025 Year in review](/blog/2025-12-31-2025-year-in-review)

## 🍀 Life

Holidays, dinners, family gatherings, visits, dinners, sickness. You name it.
This month, we had it all!

Christmas was really chill this year at my SO's family. Fantastic food,
excellent company, and our daughter got to open a bunch of gifts.

For New Year Eve today, we're eating dinner with friends of ours that has a
daughter the same age as ours. We'll head home before the fireworks start and
just take in the new year by watching a movie and doing a no-stress celebration.

## 🎬 Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

### Movies

- **Idiocracy (2006)** – I remembered this movie being better...
- **General Magic (2019)** – Incredible story. I had never heard about this
  General Magic company before watching this doc. And like the doc clearly lays
  out, they were ahead of their time with their "smartphone", but they
  absolutely paved the way for Apple, and others.
- **Rain Man (1988)** – I believe Tom Cruise is like this in real life, he's not
  actually acting 😂
- **Sick of Myself (2022)** – WTF. The director/writer must know someone like
  this. And it's sick that people actually will go to these lengths just for
  attention. And I see a clear similarity between The Substance and this movie.
- **Avatar: Fire and Ash (2025)** – It has touching moments, a bunch of weird
  dialog and even cringe dialog. The action was cool, but what threw me off from
  the whole movie and annoyed me from start to end was that some of the movie is
  24 FPS and some of it is 48 (felt higher). So whenever the movie went from 48
  to 24 FPS the movie felt like a videogame and felt like it was lagging.
- **Marty Supreme (2025)** – This movie had everything: an obnoxious
  protagonist, obnoxious supporting characters, likable story, fucked up events,
  awesome setting (1950s). This movie kept me entertained from start to finish.

### TV

Still watching **Pluribus S1**, we also started watching **Fallout S2**.

### Games

Still playing a lot of **ARC Raiders**. I feel like a kid when I get to play it.
The game is so easy to just pick up, and if I end up losing, it's not the end of
the world. I just kept the loot safe the other guy 😂
