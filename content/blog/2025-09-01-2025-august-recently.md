Summer's coming to an end, I've been at work for a month, and here's what I've
been up to since July!

From the blog this month:

- [Volkswagen ID. Buzz first impressions](/blog/volkswagen-id-buzz-first-impressions/)
- [Hima devlog #0][hima_devlog]

## 💪 Health

Something happened to me this month, after starting back at work in August I
started waking up before my alarm, and I began to wake up earlier and earlier.
So now I wake up before 06:00 every day, around 07:00 in the weekends. This has
resulted in me going for a 5 km run or strength training for the last 14 days.
I'm very happy with this!

## 🧑‍💻 Development

Not a lot has happened this month except for some stuff on Hima, which I've
[teased in a blogpost][hima_devlog]. I'm working on the next devlog as I'm
writing this.

And this month, in September, it's going to be a full year since I started
writing Go. Hopefully I'll have a post about it next week. I've been so
fortunate that the first codebase I started out in I'm still maintaining at
work, and it's been generating revenue steadily for the last 9 months.

## 🎬 Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

### Movies

- **Together (2025)** – WTF. Weird concept. Weird story. Fucked ending.
- **Final Destination (2000)** – Was this any good back in 2000?

### TV

- **The Wire S1** – This show has been recommended to me for a long long time,
  and now I understand what all the fuzz has been about. Looking forward to
  watching the rest!!

- [Why do software developers love complexity?] – I don't think any developers
  start out wanting complexity. I think it's a social/culture issue where
  developers are unable to say no to stuff, and it keeps on getting bigger and
  more complex. But it depends!
