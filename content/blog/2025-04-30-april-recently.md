Spring is upon us! It's getting warmer, brighter, and summer is just around the
corner! And April is over, and I haven't written a damn thing this month ‚Äì oh
well.

## üçÄ Life

Every month I'm amazed at just how much our daughter can change and develop.
This month she surpassed 250 words, and now we're officially done counting üòÇ
She can speak in sentences with more than four words, and it gets better every
day. Just today she managed to put on her shoes after I asked her before heading
to kindergarten. We couldn't be more proud!

Like I mentioned last month, my SO got a new job and she started this month.
She's holding up well and enjoying it, the flexible workday is working very well
for us. It makes it easy for one of us to either do drop-off or pick-up at the
kindergarten, just the small things.

We went to my sister's confirmation last weekend back in my hometown. It was
nice to see the family, and especially my sister. She had a speech at the
confirmation-thingy for all the others in front off hundreds people. We're so
proud of her!

## üí™ Health

I kept my goal from last month! Found a regular routine, and I think it was very
much thanks to my SO's new job, it just made everything easier in terms of time.
The goal now is to remain on this course and just show up!

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

Not much has happened with [Hima](https://sr.ht/~timharek/hima/). I improved the
receipt-process a bit, made it easier to use. I wasn't able to sneak in any
more. I think my head has been preoccupied with work, with deadlines and just
really enjoying on my day-to-day work. I know, it's all excuses, one day Hima
will see the light of day. Who knows, maybe you'll use it one day.

Besides Hima, I did do some minor stuff with [yr](https://sr.ht/~timharek/yr/).
You can now see emojis as the weather symbol. It amazes me how much I actually
use this CLI-tool, just to check the weather. I have also tried to start on a
TUI-thingy, but the stuff I have done so far seems to be much more complicated
than the whole CLI-tool in itself. And do I really need a TUI for checking the
weather?

## üé¨ Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

### Movies

- **We Live in Time (2024)** ‚Äì Hits close to home, heartbreaking story.

- **Alien: Romulus (2024)** ‚Äì Cool movie, I liked most of the effects. The
  ending was meh, but overall cool.

- **Ford v Ferrari (2019)** ‚Äì Cars, cars, cars! Adrenaline fueled movie, a fun
  watch!

- **Training Day (2001)** ‚Äì Rewatch. Fun cop-movie, it still holds up!

### TV

Started watching **Andor S2** and **MobLand S1** this month. Both shows are
pretty good. MobLand might land in my favorites of the year. I don't know what's
so good about it, but it's so damn intriguing ‚Äì mobsters in the UK.

- **Adolescence S1** ‚Äì Intense, thought-provoking and incredible storytelling.
  How everything was one take, how everything felt fluid and believable. I've
  never watched anything like it. Good characters, acting, and story overall.

- **Daredevil: Born Again S1** ‚Äì The ending made the show better. Some stuff
  felt rushed, the CGI stuff in the first couple of episodes was so weird
  compared to the original Netflix series. The Punisher stuff was excellent!
  Hopefully we can see more of him in the future.

- **Succession S4** ‚Äì This took so long to finish. This season kept on getting
  more and more boring. And I had to find out how it ended, and I was surprised.
  But man was this boring...

- **Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke S1** ‚Äì WTF. When everything is
  content, and religion can be your excuse. I don't have fucking words.

### Books

- **The Body, Bill Bryson** ‚Äì Fascinating stuff. The body is a complex piece of
  flesh. And now, thanks to this book, I have lots of facts I can use on
  occasion! Thanks, Bill! Jokes aside, I've learned lots. Everything from how
  complex our eyes are to how antibiotics was discovered and to how messed up
  the US health-stuff is.
