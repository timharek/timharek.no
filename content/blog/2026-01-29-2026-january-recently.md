1/12 of 2026 is almost at an end, and I'm certain that I won't be able to write
this post at any date later in January. And that's because I get the keys to my
new house tomorrow!

This is going to be a short update!

## 🍀 Life

During the last days of 2025 I was looking forward going back to work again, but
when I got back, I still had a feeling of wanting or actually longing for
time-off. It took a good week for things to go back to normal.

The beginning of January wasn't too eventful, but the last two weeks has been a
lot more fruitful than expected. Long story short, the bank and I made some bad
assumptions based on our finances (it's all good now!), which then lead to us
handover our old place 4 days earlier. That meant we had to GTFO earlier, and
wash down the old place in 4 days instead of 8 😅 But hey, we made it! As I'm
writing this we've been staying with my SO's parents for a week.

Tomorrow marks a new beginning for us, I'm really excited!

## 🧑‍💻 Development

I've been doing some refactoring on my personal logging CLI,
[art](https://git.sr.ht/~timharek/art). Where I utilize Go's interfaces a lot
more. I reimplemented all the different log entry types to use common
interfaces, one for a standard entry, and another for entries that has a review.
It's far from perfect, but in its current state it works really well.

## 🎬 Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

### Movies

- **The Menu (2022)** – Expected some of the stuff to happen. The execution was
  really good, but some of the acting felt off. But the overall theme and
  message was really fitting. One goal of mine is to never become a snob.
- **Rental Family (2025)** – Heartfelt movie, and what a strange concept. I kept
  thinking that this would never work in Norway because it's such a small
  country, Tokyo has almost three times our population 😅
- **28 Years Later: The Bone Temple (2026)** – Brutally good! I was not
  expecting this good of a movie. There were some brutal scenes in this movie,
  and the acting was overall very good. Jimmy and Jimmies, fuck, idunno. Really
  looking forward to the next one!

### TV

We're watching **Fallout S2** and **A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms S1**, we're
enjoying both. Fallout seems a bit slower this time around, and AKotSK is a
breath of fresh air in the Game of Thrones universe.
