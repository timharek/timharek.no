Fall is upon us! It's getting colder and darker everyday now, it's starting to
smell like fall. Anyhow, this is what I've been up to this month!

From the blog since my last recently post:

- [A year with Go]

## 🍀 Life

Not a whole lot is happening here. Our daughter is still surprising us every day
with something new she knows, says, or does. Being a parent is really fun!

I haven't mentioned on the blog before, at least not in a recently post, but I
play table top roleplaying games. Just yesterday we had our official session #1
of [Daggerheart](https://www.daggerheart.com/). After trying a bunch of
different games the last two years, this was really fun. We had a session #0
where we made our characters together, and this time our goal is to play the
whole campaign in person. We've had a hybrid before, but nothing beats playing
in person. Let the dice roll! 🎲

## 💪 Health

I have kept waking up early most days and have managed to run semi-regularly,
which is just what I want and need. Being able to go for a run before taking my
daughter to kindergarten and going to work makes things a lot easier and doable.
I'm hoping for a mild fall and winter so I can keep up this regime.

## 🧑‍💻 Development

It's been a year since [I started writing Go][A year with Go], and I'm still
going strong.

This month I haven't really done any personal development stuff, I have done a
bunch of work stuff. Creating my own struct-tag parser, documentation generator,
refactored a whole lot of code, from technical debt to technical wealth (thanks
[nilsnh]).

## 🎬 Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

### Movies

- **Weapons (2025)** – The director's previous movie was a banger. This was
  another banger. But WTF!? How the story is told fits really good for this
  movie. A lot of mysteries, a lot of uncanny stuff that just keeps you on the
  edge of your seat.
- **Rebel Royals: An Unlikely Love Story (2025)** – It's incredible that our
  Norwegian government has financed this couple... I have no words.
- **Novocaine (2025)** – WTF. This kept getting more and more ridiculous. The
  origin story of a guy that got laid once.

### TV

- **Dexter: Resurrection (2025)** – He's back, again! This new show makes up for
  the badly handled ending for the original show and the last episode of New
  Blood. The new show brings a lot more mysteries with it, new and old
  characters. They used what worked from New Blood, and removed what didn't. I'm
  hopeful for the continuation of the story!
- **The Wire (2002)** – It's all connected! Drugs, murders, gangsters.
  Everything!
- **Alien: Earth (2025)** – Cool story. It brings more depth to the aliens
  themselves, but I'm a bit confused by the timelines. This is before the first
  movie, but the characters in the first movie didn't know anything about the
  aliens. And the last minute in the finale is corny af.
