Started off as an integration with a single ERP, 24SevenOffice, but is now
supporting Tripletex as well. The integration has a lot of moving parts as it
syncs a bunch of different data one- and two-ways. For 24SO's part we
used their SOAP API against CW's GraphQL (read) and OpenAPI (write). For Tripletex
we used their OpenAPI API against CW's APIs.
